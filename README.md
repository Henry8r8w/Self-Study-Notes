# Welcome to My Notes Repo

This is a repository with notes and resources I want to store for future reference. The notes are written in Markdown and accompanied by some code examples/challenges to put ideas into practice. I use VS Code to maintain this backup and hope to use this repository as a reminder for my studies both in and outside the classroom. The topics are selected based on my interests, which intersect in signal processing, embedded software, econometrics, and some cool CS concepts I began learning during my time in school.

Please note that the notes are paraphrased and rewritten. Some coding examples will be cited and translated, while others are personal attempts. 
I claim no ownership of the original materials and kindly welcome all criticism for any mistakes. This repository is always being updated and improved. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me.
