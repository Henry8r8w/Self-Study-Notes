### Properties of Energy and Power Signals

An energy signal $x(t)$ has zero power  
$$P_x = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{2T} \underbrace{\int_{-T}^{T} |x(t)|^2 dt}_{\to E_x < \infty} = 0$$

A power signal has infinite energy  
$$E_x = \lim_{T\to\infty}(2T) \underbrace{\frac{1}{2T}  \int_{-T}^{T} |x(t)|^2 dt}_{\to P_x > 0}$$

### Signal Energy and Power
Let $i(t)$ be the current through a resistor, then the energy dissipated in the resistor is  
$$E_R = \lim_{T \to \infty }\int^{T}_{-T} i^2 (t) R dt$$

The signal energy for a (possibly complex) signal $x(t)$ is  
$$E_x  = \lim_{T \to \infty }\int^{T}_{-T} |x(t)|^2 dt$$

The average of the signal energy over time is the signal power.

### Complex Signals, Complex Numbers
$z(t) = x(t) + jy(t), j = \sqrt{-1}$  
- $x = \text{Re}\{z\}$  
- $y = \text{Im}\{z\}$  
- $x$ and $y$ are also called the in-phase and quadrature components of $z$  

Complex number in polar form: $z = re^{j \phi}$  
- $r$: modulus/magnitude of $z$  
- $\phi$: angle/phase of $z$  
- $\exp(j\phi)$: $\cos(\phi) + j\sin(\phi)$  
$$e^{z} = e^{x+jy} = e^{x}e^{jy} = e^{x}(\cos(y)+ j\sin(y))$$

### Causal Signals
- **Causal signals** are non-zero only for $t \geq 0$ (starts at $t = 0$, or later).  
- **Non-Causal signals** are non-zero for $t < 0$.  
- **Anti-Causal signals** are non-zero only for $t \leq 0$ (goes backward in time from $t = 0$).

### Periodic Extension
- Periodic signals can be generated by periodic extension of any segment of length one period $T_0$ (or a multiple of the period).  
- A signal defined only over an interval $T_0$ can use periodic extension to make a periodic signal.

### Periodic Signals
A continuous-time signal is periodic if and only if there exists a $T_0 > 0$ such that  
$$x(t + T_0) = x(t) \quad \forall t, T_0 \text{ is the period of } x(t).$$

A discrete-time signal is periodic if and only if there exists an integer $N_0 > 0$ such that  
$$x[n+ N_0] = x[n] \quad \forall n, N_0 \text{ is the period of } x[n].$$

In sum: For every period/sample, these signals are identical.  
- The smallest $T_0$ or $N_0$ is the **fundamental period** of the periodic signal.

### Discrete Amplitude Signals
- Discrete amplitude signals take on only a countable set of values.  
- **Example**: Quantized signal (binary, fixed point, floating point).  
- A digital signal is a quantized discrete-time signal.  
- Requires treatment as a random process (not part of this course).

### Even and Odd Symmetry
An even signal is symmetric about the origin:  
$$x(t) = x(-t)$$

An odd signal is anti-symmetric about the origin:  
$$x(t) = -x(-t)$$

Any signal can be decomposed into even and odd components:  
$$x_e(t) = \frac{1}{2}[x(t) + x(-t)]$$  
$$x_o(t) = \frac{1}{2}[x(t) - x(-t)]$$  

Check that:  
$$x_e(t) = x_e(-t)$$  
$$x_o(t) = -x_o(-t)$$  
$$x_e(t) + x_o(t) = x(t)$$  

The decomposition depends on the location of the origin. Shifting the signal changes the decomposition.

### Combinations of Operations
Scaling, shifting, and reversals can be performed in any order, but care is required.  
**Example:** $x(2(t-1))$:  
- Compress by 2, advance by 1 $\leftrightarrow$ Advance by 1, compress by 2.  
- $x(2(t-1))$: Shift first (magnitude: 1), then compress (magnitude: 2).  
- $x(2t-2)$: Shift first (magnitude: 2), then compress (magnitude: 2) – this is incorrect.

### Time Shift
For a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ and a time $t_1 > 0$:  
- **Advance:** $x(\tau = t) \rightarrow \tau = t - t_1, x(t - t_1)$  
- **Delay:** $x(\tau = t) \rightarrow \tau = t + t_1, x(t + t_1)$  

For a discrete-time signal $x[n]$, and an integer $n_1 > 0$:  
- **Advance:** $x[\tau = n] \rightarrow \tau = n - n_1, x[n - n_1]$  
- **Delay:** $x[\tau = n] \rightarrow \tau = n + n_1, x[n + n_1]$

### Time Reversal
$$x(-t) \text{ vs. } x(t), \quad x[-n] \text{ vs. } x[n]$$

### Time Scaling, Discrete Time
- **Compress:** $x[nk]$ – extracts every $k$th sample of $x[n]$ (intermediate samples are lost, sequence is shorter).  
- **Expand:** $x[n/m]$ – specifies every $m$th sample (intermediate samples must be synthesized, sequence is longer).

### Time Scaling, Continuous Time
- **Compress:** $x(bt), b > 1$  
- **Expand:** $x(bt), 0 < b < 1$  

### Amplitude Scaling
- Continuous: $ax(t)$  
- Discrete: $ax[n]$

### Summary
- A signal is a collection of data.
- Systems act on signals (inputs and outputs).
- Mathematically, they are similar:  
  - A signal can be represented by a function.  
  - A system can be represented by a function (the domain is the space of input signals).  
- Course emphasis: 1D signal, non-random systems.

### Discrete-Time Signals
- Samples: $x[n]$, where $n$ is an integer over some (possibly infinite) interval.  
- $x[n] = x(nT)$, where $n$ is an integer and $T$ is the sampling period.

### Continuous-Time Signals
- Function of a time variable: $t, \tau, t_1$.  
- Signal is denoted as $v, v(.),$ or $v(t)$, where $t$ is a dummy variable.

### Types of Systems
- **Continuous-time system**: Has continuous-time inputs and outputs.
  - Examples: AM or FM radio, conventional (all mechanical) car.
- **Discrete-time system**: Has discrete-time inputs and outputs.
  - Examples: PC computer game, MATLAB, your mortgage.
- **Hybrid systems**: Combine continuous and discrete systems.
  - Examples: A/D, D/A converters, modern cars with ECUs.

### Continuous and Discrete-Time Signals
- CT: Values for all points in time in some (possibly infinite) interval $(f(t))$.  
- DT: Values for only discrete points in time $(f[n])$.  

Signals can also be functions of space (images) or of space and time (video), and may be continuous or discrete in each dimension.

### Systems
A system takes a signal and converts it into another signal.  
- Internally, a system may contain many different types of signals.  
- The systems perspective considers all these together.

### Signals
Any physical or abstract quantity that can be measured and conveys information can be thought of as a signal.
