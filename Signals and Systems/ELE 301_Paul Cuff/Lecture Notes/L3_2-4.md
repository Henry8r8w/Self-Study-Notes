For an input x(t), the output of an linear system is given by the superposition integral
$$y(t) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}x(\tau)h_{\tau}(t)d\tau$$

If the system is aslo time invariant, the result is a convolution integral
$$y(t) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}x(\tau)h(t - \tau)$$

The reponse of an LTI system is completely characterized by its impulse reponse h(t)

Another expression for the superposition integral can be found by substituting for $\tau = t - \tau_1$, then $d\tau = -d\tau_1$ and $\tau_1 = t -\tau$

$$y(t) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} x(\tau)h(t-\tau)d\tau$$

$$y(t) = \int^{-\infty}_{\infty} x(t - \tau_1) h(t-(t-\tau_1))d(-\tau_1)$$
$$y(t) = \int^{\infty}_


### System Equation
The System Equation relates the outputs of a system to its inputs. Example from last time: the system described by the block diagram


$x -> (+)_+, (+) -> integral ->y, y * a -> (+)_-$
- $y' = x - ax$, where i_0 specify a solution

Solutions for the System Equastion
- The output consists of two components
    1. zero-input reponse, which is where what system does when input x(t) = 0 ->[H] -> y
    2. zero-state reponse, wich is the output of the system with inital conditions to be zeros

- If H is a linear system , its zeroinput reponse is zero. Homogeneity states if y = F(ax) = aF(x). If a = 0, which gives a zero input of x, then the output should be zero

example: Solve for the voltage across the capacitor y(t) for an arbitrary input voltage x(t), iven an inital value $y(0) = Y_0$
x(t)(-+) - i(t) -> R - > C (+-)/ y(t)-> (-+)x(t)
- KVL: x(t) = R*i(t) + y(t)
- Using $i(t) = Cy'(t), x(t) = RCy'(t) + y(t) = x(t)$
- $i_o = 0, RCy'(t) + y(t) = 0$
    - Using first order odrinary equation $\frac{dy}{dt} + p(t) y + q(t)$  and multiplying factor of$ \mu = e^{\int P(t)}$, we have $y(t) = Ae^{-t/ Rc}$
- Sub y(t) back
$$RC[A'(t)e^{-t/RC}-\frac{1}{Rc}A(t)e^{-t/RC}]+A(t)e^{-t/RC} = x(t)$$
Simplifying
$$A'(t) = x(t)[\frac{1}{RC}e^{t/RC}] \tp A(t) = \int^{t}_{0}x(\tau)[\frac{1}{RC}e^{\tau / RC}]d \tau + A(0)$$

Given $y(t) = A(t)e^{-t/ Rc}$
$$y(t) =  [\int^{t}_{0}x(\tau)[\frac{1}{RC}e^{\tau / RC}]d \tau + A(0)]e^{-t/Rc}$$

At t = 0, y(0) = Y_0, so this gives A(0) = Y_0
$$y(t) = \underbrace{\int^{t}_{0}x(\tau)[\frac{1}{Rc}e^{-(t-\tau)/RC}] d\tau}_{\text{zero-state reponse}} + \underbrace{Y_0e^{-t/RC}}_{zero-input reponse}

let's verify

The impulse reponse (h(t))
 $h(t) = \frac{1/RC}e^{-t/RC}$ (NOTE: need to find the derivation)

Then the reponse of this system to an input x(t) is 
$$y(t) = \int^{t}_{0} x(\tau)h_{\tau}(t)d\tau  = \int^{t}_{0}x(\tau)[\frac{1}{RC}e^{-(t-\tau)/RC}]d\tau$$, which is the zero state solution found earlier

### Output of an LTI system
$x -> [H] -> y$

signal $x(t)$ as a sample of itself:
$$x(t) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}x(\tau)\delta_{\tau}(t)d\tau$$
- note: this expression implies x(t) is now a weighted integral of delta

Apply weighted x(t) to H: $y(t) = H(x(t)) = H(\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}x(\tau)\delta_{\tau}(t)d\tau)$
implies
$$ y(t) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} x(\tau)H(\delta_{\tau}(t))$$
implies
$$y(t) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}x(\tau)h_{\tau}(t)d\tau$$
    - this is superposition integral. The values of x(tau)h(t, tau)d tau are superimposed (added up) for each input time tau
    - if the superposition integral is time invariant, we would call this form of a convolution integral

### Time-Invariance
Definition: If H is time invariant, delaying the input and output both by a time $\tau$ should produce the same reponse
$$h_\tau = h(t - \tau)$$
<insert png>

Linearity: A system S is linear if it satifies both
- Homogeneity: if $y = Sx$, and a is a constant
    - $ay = S(ax)$
- Superposition: if $y_1 = Sx_1, y_2 = Sx_2$, then
    - $y_1 + y_2 = S(x_1 + x_2)$

Thus,
$$ay_1 + b_2 = S(ax_1 + bx_2)$$

Extended linearity
- Summation: if $y_n = Sx_n$ for all n, an integer from $(\infty < n < \infty)$, and $a_n$ are constant
$$\sum_{n} a_ny_n = S(\sum_n a_nx_n)$$
    - note: summation and the system operator commute
- Itnegration (simple sample): if $y = Sx$
$$\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}a(\tau)y(t- \tau)d\tau = S(\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}a(\tau)x(t- \tau)d\ta)
     - note: integration and the system operator commute

### Impulse Response
The impulse reponse of a linear system $h_{\tau}$ is the output of the system at time t to an impulse at time $\tau$ (t - tau) with a system H can be written as
$h_{\tau} = H(\delta_{\tau})$
<insert png>
note: positive tau cause a forward shift of signal and gives the sampling range of t-tau 

note: left-hand side t serve a specific value for time, which is different of t on the right hand side -- it varies over all the real number (e.g, all time t; due to its impulse nature), but it is still something that specific time t is dependent on
$$h_{\tau}(t) = H(\delta_{\tau}(t))$$ is a confusing one
    - at $\tau = 0$, $h = h_0 = H(\delta_0)$
    - using $ t= 2$ to do evaluation, $h(2) = H(\delta(2))$ implies h(2) = H(0), which is wrong
        - a better notation for the process: $h(t, tau) = h(2, 0) - h(t, 0)$
