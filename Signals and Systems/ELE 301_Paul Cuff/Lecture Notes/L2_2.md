### 2nd Order Circuit Example
$x (-+) -> L -> R ->C/y(t)(+-) -> (-+)x$

KVL:
$$x - Li' - Ri - y = 0$$
using i = Cy'
$$x - LCy'' - RCy' - y = 0$$


### Examples
Scaling system ($a_0 = 1, \ b_0 = a$)  
$$y = ax$$

Integrator ($a_1 = 1, \ b_0 = 1$)  
$$y' = x$$

Differentiator ($a_0 = 1, \ b_1 = 1$)  
$$y = x'$$

Integrator with feedback (a few slides back, $a_1 = 1, \ a_0 = a, \ b_0 = 1$)  
$$y' + ay = x$$


### Systems Descrhibed by Differential equations
Many systems are described by a _linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equation (LCCODE)_


$$a_n y^{(n)}(t) + \cdots + a_1 y'(t) + a_0 y(t) = b_m x^{(m)}(t) + \cdots + b_1 x'(t) + b_0 x(t)$$

with given _initial conditions_

$$
y^{(n-1)}(0), \ \dots, \ y'(0), \ y(0)
$$

(which fixes $y(t)$, given $x(t)$)
- n is called the order of the system
- $b_0, ..., b_m, a_0, ...,  a_n$ are the coefficients of the system

Note that an LCCODE gives an implicit description of a system.
- It describes how x (t ), y (t ), and their derivatives interrelate
- It doesnâ€™t give you an explicit solution for y (t ) in terms of x (t )
### System Invertibility
A system is invertible if the input signal can be recovered from the output signal

$y = Fx; x = F^{inv}y = F^{inv}Fx$
- $x ->[F] -> y ->[F^{inv}] -> x$

note: $F^{inv}F = I$, the indentity operator

example:
- AM Radio Transmitter and receiver
- multi-path echo cancelator
### Example: Cruise control
$x -> (+)_+, (+)-\text{error}->[k]-\text{gas} -> [H] ->y, [H][k]y -> (+)_-$

Output: $y = H(k(x -y))$

The system can become unstable if k is too large (depending on H )
- Positive error adds gas
- Delay car velocity change, speed overshoots
- Negative error cuts gas off
- Delay in velocity change, speed undershoots
- Repeat

### System Stability
- Stability important for most engineering applications.
- Many definitions
- In a system's definition, if a bounded input
$$|x(t)| \leq M_x < \infty$$
always results in a bounded output
$$|y(t)| \leq M_y < \infty,$$
where $M_x$ and $M_y$ are finite positive numbers, the system is _Bounded Input Bounded Output_ (BIBO) stable
>

### Time-Invariance
- A system is time-invariant if a time shift in the input produces the same time shift in the output
- For a system F, 
$$y(t) = Fx(t)$$
implies that 
$$y(t- \tau) = Fx(t -\tau)$$
for any time shift $\tau$

- implies that delay and the system F commute

### System Memory
- A system is memoryless if the output depends only on the 
**present input**.
    - Ideal amplifier
    - Ideal gear, transmission, or lever in a mechanical system

- A system with memory has an output signal that depends on **inputs in the past or future**.
    - Energy storage circuit elements such as capacitors and inductors
    - Springs or moving masses in mechanical systems

- A causal system has an output that depends only on **past or present inputs**.
    - Any real physical circuit, or mechanical system.


### Linearity
A system F is linear if the following two properties hold:
1. homogeneity: if x is any signal and _a_ is any scaler
- $F(ax) = aF(x)$
2. superposition: if x and $\tilde{x}$ are any two signals
- $F(x+\tilde{x}) = F(x)+F(\tilde{x})$


In words, linearity means:
- Scaling before or after the system is the same
    - $x-> (a) -> [F] -> \equiv x-> [F]->(a) ->y$
- Summing before or after the system is the same
    - $x_1 -> (+), x_2 -> (+), (x) -> [F] -> y \equiv x_1 -> [F]_1 -> (+), x_2 -> [F]_2 -> (+), (+)->y$; note: F_1 is the same system as F_2

Examples of linear systems: scaling system, differentiator, integrator, running average, time shift, convolution, modulator, sampler.

Examples of nonlinear systems: sign detector, multiplier (sometimes), comparator, quantizer, adaptive filter

Multiplier as a modulator, $y(t) = x(t) cos(2\pi ft)$, is linear
- $x -> (x), cos(2\pi ft)-> (x), (x) ->y$

Multiplier as a squaring system, $y(t) = x^2(t)$ is nonlinear
- $x->(x),x ->(x), (x)->y$

### Interconnection of Systems
- Cascade (or series): y = G(F(x)) = GFx
    - $x ->[f]-> [g] -> y$
- sum (or parrallel): y = Fx + Gx
    - $x->[f] -> (+), x -> [g] ->(+), (+) -> y$
- feedback: $y = F(x- Gy)$
    - $x ->(+)_+ -> [F] -> y, [G]y -> (+)_-, (+)_{+,-} -> [F] -> y$

Example: Integrator with feedback
- input to integrator is $x - ay$, where _a_ is the system of the feedback given by y
$$ \int^{t} (x(\tau)- ay(\tau))d\tau = y(t)$$
which  makes the deriative
$$x - ay = y'$$

### Examples with multiple inputs
summing system: $y(t) = x_1(t)+x_2(t)$

$x_1 \to (+), x_2 \to (+)$

$(+) \to y$

difference system: $y(t) = x_1(t)-x_2(t)$

$x_1 \to (+)_+, x_2 \to (+)_-$

$(+) \to y$

summing system: $y(t) = x_1(t)x_2(t)$

$x_1 \to (x), x_2 \to (x)$

$(x) \to y$


### Block Diagram
$x \to [s] \to y$
- Lines with arrows denote signals
- Boxes denoe systemss; arrows show inputs & outtputs
examples
Scaling system: $y(t) = ax(t)$
- Called an amplifier if $|a|> 1$
- Called an attenuator if $|a|< 1$
-Called inverting if $a < 0$
- a is called the gain or scale factor.
- Sometimes denoted by triangle or circle in block diagram

time shift system : $y(t) = x(t - T)$
- delay system if $T>0$
- predictor system if $T<0$

convolution system: $y(t) = \int x(t- \tau)h(\tau)d\tau$, where h is a given function
### Systems
- A system transforms input signals into output signals.
- A system is a function mapping input signals into output signals.
- We will concentrate on systems with one input and one output i.e. single-input, single-output (SISO) systems

Notation:
- $y = Sx, y = S(x)$, meaning the system S acts on an input signal x to produce output signal y

### Integrals and Deriatives of impulsive functions
example: $x(t) = 1 + \delta(t -1)-2\delta(t-2)$
- let $y(t) = \int^{t}_{0}x(\tau) d\tau$
- $y'(t) = 1 + \delta(t -1)-2\delta(t-2)$

Integration by parts suggests we define
$$\int^{\infty}_{\infty} \delta '(t)f(t)dt = \delta(t)f(t)|^{\infty}_{-\infty}
- \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\delta(t)f'(t) = -f'(0)$$
provided f' continuous at t = 0

General Defintion (k-oder impulse):
$$\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \delta^{(t)}(t)f(t)dt = (-1)^{k}f^{(k)}(0)$$
provided f^k continuous at t = 0

Interpretation of doublet $\delta '$: take two impulses with magnitude $\pm 1/ \epsilon$, a dsitance $\epsilon$ and let $\epsilon \to 0$

Then
$$\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(t)(\frac{\delta(t)}{\epsilon} - \frac{\delta(t - \epsilon)}{\epsilon}) dt = \frac{f(0) - f(\epsilon)}{\epsilon}$$

**Caveat**
$\delta(t)$ is not a signal or function in the ordinary sense, it only makes mathematical sense when inside an integral sign

- It is safe to use impulsive function in expression like
$$\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(t)\delta(t - T)dt, \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(t)\delta '(t - T)dt$$
provided f(repectively, f') is continuos at t = T
- Else, we should not consider modification on the delta(t), like $delta(t)^2$ or $\delta(t^2)$; it is not a function, but a sampling notation


### Physical Interpretation
Impulse functions are used to model physical signals
- that act over short time intervals 
- whose effect depends on integral of signal

ex. at t = 2, a = 1.999, b = 2.001

ex. rapid charging of capacitor with 1V battery -> switch -> 1F capacitor -> battery model
- Assuming v(0) = 0, what is v(t), i(t) for t > 0
    - i(t) is very large, for a very short time (delta(t))
    - a unit charge is transferred to the capacitor almost instataneuosly
    - v(t) increases to v(t) = 1 'almost instantaneously' (integrated(delta(t)))
- As $I_{max} \to \infty$, i approaches an impulse, v appraoches a unit step
### Limits of Integration
The integral of a $\delta$ is non-zero only if it is in the integration interval
- If a < 0 and b > 0 then
$$\int^{b}_{a} \delta(t) dt = 1$$
- If a > 0 or b < 0 , and a < b then
$$\int^{b}_{a} \delta(t) dt = 0$$
becuase the $\delta$ is outside the integration interval
- Ambiguous if a = 0 or b = 0

Convention: using limits such as a - or b+ to denote whether we include the impulse or not


### Shifting property
- $x(t) = \delta(t- T)$ is an impulse function with impulse t = T
- For f continuous at t = T
$$\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(t)\delta(t - T)dt = f(T)$$
- Multiplying impulse at time T and integrating, samples the f(t) at T

### Multiplication of a Function by an Impulse
- Substiute the function into the fomal definition with a continuous f(t) and evaluate

$$\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(t) [\phi(t)\delta(t)] dt = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} [f(t)\phi(t)]\delta(t) dt  = f(0)\phi(0)$$

Hence, given $\phi(t) = \phi(0)$ is a scaled impulse with strength $\phi(0)$

### Scaled Impulses
$a\delta(t)$ is an impulse at time T, with magnitude or strength $\alpha$, thus

$$\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \alpha \delta(t) f(t) dt = \alpha f(0)$$
provied f is continuous at 0

### Example: Model $\delta(t) \text{ as } g_n(t) = n \text{rect}(nt)$
- as $n \to\infty$, the area becomes (n) (1/n)
- if $f(t)$ is continous at $t = 0$, then
$$\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(t)\delta(t) dt = \lim_{n\to \infty}\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(t)g_n(t)dt = f(0) \int^{\infty}_{\infty}g_n(t)dt = f(0)$$

### Formal properties (of delta)
$$ \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} f(t) \delta(t)dt= f(0)$$
provided f is contiuous at t = 0

idea: $\delta$ acts over a time interval very small, over which $f(t) \approx f(0)$
- Conceptually $\delta(t) = 0 \text{ for } t \neq 0$, infinite at t =0, while mathmatically it is not logical

### Impulsive signals
(Dirac's) delta function or impulse $\delta$ is an idealization of a signal that
- is very large near t = 0
- is very small away from t = 0
- has integral 1

- note: the exact shape of the function does not matter
    - the range of the signal is denoted by $2 \epsilon$
    - the height of the signal is denoted by $1/ \epsilon$

### More Complex Signals
ex. Pulsed Doppler RF Waveform
- $cos(\omega t)$ ated for $\tau$ duration , repeated by every T, and for a total of N pulses
<insert png>

ex. square signal
- start with rect(t)
- scale the duration you want rect($at$), where a is fraction there will be a compression and integers there will be an expansion
    - $A rect(t/ \tau)$
- Combine shifted replicas 
    - $\sum^{2}_{n = -2}A rect((t- nT)/ \tau)$
    - note: -nT shifts by every n, $1/\tau$ compresses by tau
### Unit Triangle
$$Tri(t) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 - |t|,& \text{if} |t| < 1 \\ 
0, \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

### Unit Ramp
$$r(t) = \begin{cases} t, & t \geq 0 \\ 0, & t < 0 \end{cases}$$
The unit ramp is the integral of the unit step
$$r(t) = \int^{t}_{-\infty} u(\tau) d\tau$$

#### Unit Step Functions
$$ u(t) =
\begin{cases} 
1, & t \geq 0 \\
0, & t < 0
\end{cases}$$

Uses for the unit step:
- Extract part of another signal, a piecewise-defined signal
$$ x(t) = \begin{cases} e^{-t}, & t \geq 0 \\ 0, & t < 0 \end{cases}$$
Given an modulation of u(t)
$x(t) = u(t)e^{-t}$

<insert png>
- Combinations of unit steps to create rectangular signal
$$x(t) = \begin{cases} 0, & t \geq 1 \\ 1, & 0\leq t < 1 \\ 0, & t < 0$$
which can be written as
$$x(t) = u(t) - u(t-1)$$

- Unit rectangle signal
$$ x(t) = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if} |t|\leq 1/2 \\0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

### Complex Plane
Each complex frequnecy $s = \delta + j\omega$ corresponds to a position in the complex plane (vertical: $j\omega$, horizontal: $\delta$)

- Left Half Plane: $\delta < 0 $, decreasing signals
- Right Half Plane $\delta > 0 $, inreasing signals



### Damped or Growing Sinusoids 
$$x(t) = e^{\delta t}cos(\omega t + \theta)$$
- $\delta$ modulate the sinusoids (greater than or less than 0)
The exponetial version:
$$ e^{(\delta + j\omega)t + j \theta} = e^{\delta t}(cos(\omega t + \theta)+ i sin(\omega t + \theta))$$

### Exponential Signals
Definition: $x(t) = e^{\delta t}$
- decay if $\delta < 0$ and growth if $\delta > 0$

### Complex Sinusoids
- Euler relation: $e^{j \phi} = cos(\phi) + j sin(\phi)$
- Sinusoid: $Ae^{j(\omega t + \theta)} = Acos(\omega t + \theta) + jAsin(\omega t + \theta); Re{Ae^{j(\omega t + \theta)}}= Acos(\omega t + \theta)$

### Sinusoidal Sisgnals
Form: $x(t) = cos(\omega t + \theta) \leftrightarrow Acos(2\pi f t+ \theta)$
- $\omega = 2\pi f$ has units of radians/s; it is the radian frequency
- The period of sinusoid is $ T = 1/ f = 2 \pi / \omega$
